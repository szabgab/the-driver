Driver is inspired by LOGO and robotics games.

There are simple turtles and more complex robots users 
can program to do things in all kinds of mazes.


The most simple framework will probably be similar
to a basic version of the turtle of LOGO.

We need to implement a simple language to drive that turtle.

GO 100;    # in pixels
LEFT 23;   # in degree
RIGHT 17;  # in degree

In more advanced versions the bots will have sensors (visual, touch etc)
that can work at various distances.
Users can implement triggers on various events of the sensors.
The bots will also have several wheels and each wheel will get its 
own instructions.

We will provide a place where the bots can move around.
The most basic is a plain field (a screen) where one can draw.
